# app.name is used:
# with app.environment for creating a zookeeper name space
# with app.environment for creating Dynamo table names
# with app.environment for publishing Hosted Graphite metrics
# with s3.environment for the S3 bucket

# optional value for how long Spoke caches data, defaults to 60
